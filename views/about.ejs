      <h2>Why I Started This Website</h2>
      <div class="about-content">
        <div class="about-text">
          <p><strong>Readsy</strong> is a personal collection of thoughts on the books that have shaped me. I started this website as a way to combine my love for reading with a desire to reflect more deeply on the lessons and themes within each book.</p>
          <p>This journal is more than just a book list—it’s a place to store meaningful insights, takeaways, and favorite moments from the books I read. I hope my notes and reviews inspire others to explore these books and think critically about their own reading experiences.</p>

      <p class="about-text philosophy-text">
          I read across multiple genres, from fiction to non-fiction, and my approach to reading is not just about finishing a book but about engaging deeply with its content. Each book offers something unique, whether it's a lesson about the world or an insight into human nature.
